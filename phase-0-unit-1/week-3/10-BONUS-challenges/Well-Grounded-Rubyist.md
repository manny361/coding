- Identify and explain how to iterate through collections
- Compare data structures

## Summary
*The Well-Grounded Rubyist* by David A. Black is an excellent resource to give you a solid foundation in Ruby. There are currently two editions. The second edition just came out, and we've negotiated a discount code for this edition that will give you 45% off the list price.* The code is: **rubycl14**. We have negotiated this code especially for Dev Bootcamp students.**

You may also use the first edition if you would like. The second will be relevent longer since it's been updated for Ruby 2.0, but the first edition also has many of the basic fundamentals that will still help.

We highly recommend purchasing a copy of this book to assist you as you move through the Phase 0 and Phase 1 curriculum.

NOTE: Chapter numbers are based on the 2nd edition of the book.

*The coupon only applies for the 2nd edition, for either a digital or physical copy. The code should work internationally. If you have problems, please try clearing the cookies and re-trying.

**Please respect our agreement with Manning Publications by not sharing this coupon code with anyone else or providing digital copies to others. If these things happen, it will result in the loss of the discount and damage DBC's reputation.

## Releases

## Release 0: Bootstrapping your Ruby Literacy
Read chapter 1 on bootstrapping your ruby literacy. There are some complex concepts with regard to installation and extensions, but it's good to have a basic grasp of these concepts.

The book is not as readable as Chris Pine's, but it has a lot more information so be patient and work through it.

## Release 1: Objects, methods, and local variables
Read chapter 2 on objects, methods, and local variables. This chapter covers objects, which is a really important concept in Ruby, which is an object-oriented language.

## Release 2: Control-Flow Techniques
Read chapter 6 on control-flow techniques. This should help cement your understanding from this week

## Release 3: More reading
Read the following sections to solidify other concepts covered this week:
- 7.5: Boolean states, Boolean objects, and nil
- 7.6: Comparing two objects
- 8.1: Working with strings
- 8.3: Numerical Objects
- 9.1: Arrays and Hashes in comparison
- 9.2: Collections handline with arrays
- 9.3: Hashes
- 9.4: Ranges

## Release 3: Summarize (Optional)
This book can be very seductive by making you think you fully understand concepts because it explains things so well. However, you may find that just reading will not help you fully use the concepts you just read about. It may help you to solidify concepts by writing (or making a video) to teach others about one or two (or more) concepts you learned about using your own examples.

You may also take this opportunity to write a blog post about what you learned. Name this blog `ruby-foundamentals.html`. Make sure its findable from the blog index!

## Release 4: Publish (Optional)
Publish your blog on your [USERNAME].github.io. Make sure to link to it from your index! Then tweet about your awesome blog using **#DBCRubyBasics**. If you are particularly proud of your blog, you may want to tweet it @david_a_black as well! He may even respond!

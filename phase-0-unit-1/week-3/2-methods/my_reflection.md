 What I learned in this challenge were:
 - Methods: methods are objects in Ruby that help encapsulate a reusable code. For example, I can write a method that adds an *n* number of user inputs together and returns the total. A method must always begin with *def* and end with and *end*. The variable used to define the method must start with a lowercase letter. There must be no space between the words that are used to define the method; i.e.:

```ruby
def my_email(mail)
  return "Your email address is #{mail}."
end
```

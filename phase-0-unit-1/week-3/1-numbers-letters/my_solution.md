# Notes for Numbers and Letters

## Numbers

### Summary
- What does `puts` do?
- What is the difference between float and integer division?
<P>'puts' in Ruby prints the result on the screen and enters a new line. Integer division returns an integer for the result, whereas, float division returns a result with decimal point.</p>

### Try it!

My solution for:

1.  Hours in a year

```ruby
day = 24
year = 365
puts day*year
```

2. Minutes in a decade

```ruby
mins_in_an_hour = 60
mins_in_a_day = mins_in_an_hour * 24
mins_in_a_year = mins_in_a_day * 365
mins_in_a_decade = mins_in_a_year * 10

puts mins_in_a_decade
```

The first language I began my programming education in was Python. Shortly after I was introduced to Ruby. Ruby, in my opinion, is one of the easiest languages to learn. Why? Because it's English. For example, if you want to define a method you start your code by typing *def*, if you want to print something to the screen you type *print*. There are many other examples but these are just a couple that come to my mind. So I'm excited to learn Ruby and apply it in real world applications. Of all the resources I've used, the best place to begin learning Ruby is definitely [Codecademy](http//:www.codecademy.com). Currently, I understand the basics of Ruby: syntax, variables, methods, arithmitics, and conditional statements; I feel pretty confident in each of these elements but I would love to learn more, dig deeper, and code better. Here are some of my weaknesses that I must approve:
- DRY; yes I do that *after* I complete my codes. No bueno.
- Verbose; I'd like to write succinct codes
- Chunking; sometimes I get stuck at the very beginning. I must learn to chunk the problem/application into smaller segments that I can solve

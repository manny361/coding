## 11. GPS 1.1 Reflection

- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
- What was clarified during the GPS?
- What (if anything) was made more confusing?
- How was your first experience of pairing in a guided pairing session?
- Was having a guide there intimidating? helpful? reassuring?
- What were your 'aha' moments?

I did not have a good git flow and some of the git concepts I did not grasp very well. After GPS1.1 some of the git concepts and usages were cemented for me! They include:
- git push "remote-name" "branch-name", i.e. $ git push origin master
- git reset --soft HEAD~1
- git log, displays the commit logs
- git checkout "branch name", switches between branches
- git reset,
- git fetch, pulls the updated files into the specified branch
- git merge, merges all changes
- git pull "remote-name" "branch-name", i.e $ git pull origin master
The guided pairing session went well, I think, unfortunately we were not able to finish on time. Primarily because I had not read anything from the GPS challenge (as requested in **bold** letters) and I had some prior git issues that the instructor spent time resolving them. The guide wasn't intimidating, but I did feel a bit nervous, which caused me to forget some basic git commands and take more time completing a task than I normally would. That definitely wasn't the guide's fault in anyway; it's just the psychology behind having a pro watching you do something basic :-/, however, I must point out that the guide was very helpful and humble. My first 'aha' moment hit me when the guide pointed out that I should checkout to the branch I intend to push its changes to Github before adding and commiting.

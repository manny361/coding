## 2. Site Planning Reflection

*Remember, reflections should only take about 10-15 minutes.*

### Site planning

1. What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
2. What kind of content will your site feature?
3. What is the best way to share that content with users?
4. Think about your target audience. What are their interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
5. How do you think most users will find your site?
6. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
- What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

## My Reflections
### Site Planning
The primary goal of my site is to advertise myself as a potential employee. I plan on sharing what I believe is imperative and interesting for employers to know. Often times I find job interviews bland and unfulfilling. Employers cannot possibly get to know who I really am and what qualities I possess via an interview. My site should educate my potential employers thoroughly; this goal can be achieved by providing links to my social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, and Quora), a section entailing my interests, hobbies, and qualities, sample projects worked on, and hopefully some recommendations from colleagues and people I've worked with. My targeted audience are employers and recruiters. Employers spend a lot of time and money to hire the "perfect" employee. Some do extensive research on an individual before executing the hiring process. My site's aim is to help employers and recruiters find out as much about me (as an employee) possible in one place: my site. Most users should get access to my site via email. Employers and recruiters will have access to the entire site via invitation. Other users will have limited access, perhaps they can only access my blog.

### Site Map
Design is about problem solving. Design and UX go hand-in-hand. The importance of design cannot be over emphasized. The design invariably affects the user experience. A website that is easy to navigate and has relative and captivating color schemes will have more traffic flow than a website that has poor design structure.I have not yet spend much time on design and UX. It wasn't part of the preceding challenges; but planning my site was a short pleasure. I wasn't troubled by any of the concepts and so far I feel pretty confident with the learning competencies for this challenge beacause I had learned about the basic fundamentals that were covered in this challenge previously. The part I enjoyed the most about this challenge was the site-plan.

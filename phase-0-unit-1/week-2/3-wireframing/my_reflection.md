Wireframing was an interesting experience. Since I had done similar wireframing prior to my DBC experience I had a pretty good idea of where to start. For the blog template I stuck with my original design, but for the wireframe index I revised my design twice after viewing some samples. I searched for sample blogs and protfolios online from working professionals. I'm not having any difficulty with a concept but I did realize that it's very tough for me to kickstart the design. Using others' websites gave me an idea of how to design mine but I still would like to get a deeper insight of the process.
I leaned that creating a good navigation bar is essential for the website's success. As far as I know, the Google spider return search results from left-to-right top-to-bottom. Thus, a well thought out navigation bar is imperative.
My learning competencies:
- Wireframing is basically a structure on which a website is built upon. It reduces the designing and coding phases considerably. Wireframing also helps the programmer to create a consistent website. Each page will have the same structure, which is essential for UX.

I enjoyed researching other people's websites and blogs. It gave me an idea of where I should begin and what I should be aiming for. It was definitely something I enjoyed learning.
Nothing was "tedious" per se, but it did take me a while before I decided to settle for an online software to create an image of my wireframe. Silly me.
